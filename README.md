## This is a continued speech recognition system.
### The system is not complete. It only includes the recognition process from speech wave to every single phonemes, which are the elementaries that constitutes words.

Open Matlab2013b (others may not work) and run the following functions:

1. myTrain('C:\Users\DLRC\Desktop\Speech-Recognition-master\Speech-Recognition-master\Training')
	The parameter should be replaced by your own file path.
2. myRun('C:\Users\DLRC\Desktop\Speech-Recognition-master\Speech-Recognition-master\code\HMM_M8-Q3-S29-D14-I5.mat','C:\Users\DLRC\Desktop\Speech-Recognition-master\Speech-Recognition-master\Testing',14)
	The parameter should be replaced by your own file path.

And just wait for the result.
